# ReinforcementLearning
Various Reinforcement Learning scripts from the basics (Monte Carlo, TD, Sarsa) to Function Approximation of action-values (DQN) and Policy Gradient methods (Reinforce, RewardsToGo Reinforce, A2C, DDPG, PPO, SAC). Algorithms have been tested on CartPole environment for discrete action-space and Continuous LunarLander for continuous action-space
